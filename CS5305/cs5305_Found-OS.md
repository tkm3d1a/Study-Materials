### **The need for OS's - 1.1**
###### [TOC](#toc)
The operating system is the most important piece of software on a computer.

It serves as the main go-between from user and/or applications to the machines hardware

![Reason for OS](../img/CS5305/wk1_need-for-os.png)

Responsibilities of OS:
- Coordinating between different hardware components
- Handling system configurations
  - executing hardware instructions at a low level
  - this can include differing instruction sets or paradigms
- Managing independent device operation
  - Also allows for concurrent device operation
- Dealing with any specialized functionality
  - i.e. the GPU
- Handling feature creep as more options and features get added overtime

### **History and The Monitor - 1.2**
###### [TOC](#toc)

- Computers in modern form began in 1940's with Turing
- 1950's saw computers being used more and more for complicated tasks
- By the 1960's, software was finnally introduced to replace humans as the main point of interaction with the hardware
  - The start of the "operating system"
- The piece of software that runs the system is called **The monitor**
  - This is the first itteration of an operating system

*The Monitor*
- Fetches tasks from the front of the task queue
- Executes the tasks, one byt one
- Control is returned once a tasks is completed or if its execution fails
- Limitations of the monitor
  - There is no execution time limit (infinite loop problem)
  - There is no protection fror the monitor or other tasks.  Current task coul violate existing memory footprint
  - There is no ability for executing multiple tasks at once
  - The task poorly utilizes the CPU
